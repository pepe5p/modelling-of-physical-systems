Extend the SDM coagulation solver to multi-threaded operation (CPU or GPU).
Automate tests checking if results on one thread are bit-wise identical with
with results obtained on multiple threads, and check match with analytic solution.

- 33% for implementing multi-threading
- 33% for scaling tests
- 33% for code quality (incl. conciseness)
